## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements an **AI-powered medical appointment scheduling agent** that automates patient booking, reduces no-shows, and streamlines clinic operations for **MediCare Allergy & Wellness Center**. 

The system addresses critical healthcare challenges:
- **20-50% revenue loss** from no-shows and scheduling inefficiencies
- Manual patient intake processes causing delays
- Insurance collection and verification bottlenecks
- Inconsistent patient communication and reminders

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Patient Interaction**
- Natural language conversation interface
- Intelligent patient lookup and classification
- New vs. returning patient detection
- Real-time data validation

### 📅 **Smart Scheduling System**
- **60-minute slots** for new patients (comprehensive consultation)
- **30-minute slots** for returning patients (follow-up care)
- Real-time calendar integration with conflict prevention
- Multi-doctor, multi-location support

### 💳 **Insurance Collection & Verification**
- Automatic insurance information capture
- Member ID and group number validation
- Carrier verification simulation

### 📋 **Automated Form Distribution**
- Post-booking intake form delivery via email
- **Critical medication instructions** (7-day antihistamine cessation)
- HIPAA-compliant secure transmission

### 🔔 **3-Tier Reminder System**
1. **Reminder 1** (72 hours): Standard appointment confirmation
2. **Reminder 2** (24 hours): Interactive form completion check  
3. **Reminder 3** (4 hours): Final confirmation with cancellation option

### 📊 **Administrative Reporting**
- Excel export for appointment confirmations
- Reminder schedule management
- Patient database analytics
- Workflow performance metrics

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Streamlit for interactive web interface  
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for database operations
- **File Handling**: OpenPyXL for Excel integration
- **Communication**: Email/SMS simulation for notifications
- **Database**: CSV-based patient records (EMR simulation)
